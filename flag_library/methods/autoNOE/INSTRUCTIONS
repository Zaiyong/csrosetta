The method autoNOE runs RASREC with iterative automatic NOESY assignment
it can be run in two modes: phaseI and phaseII
mode phaseI is used to find an initial fold
mode phaseII is used to refine a fold

mode phaseII is selected by providing setup_target.py an ensemble of decoys with the option -silent

SPECIAL:
	 in contrast to other methods (rasrec, denovo, etc)
	 before the structure calculation can start you have to run a script to obtain initial assignments.

Procedure:

setup:
	  run setup_target.py [...] -run_dir RUNDIR

initialize:
	  cd RUNDIR
	  . initialize_assignments_phaseI.sh
or
          . initialize_assignments_phaseII.sh
( in doubt run both initialize scripts )

run:
	  cd test
	   # start test-run with source test.<platform>.job
	  cd ..
	  # start production-run with source production.<platform>.job
